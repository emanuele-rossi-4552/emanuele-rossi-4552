## Hi, I'm Emanuele 👋

I’m passionate about **IoT** and **embedded systems**, and I love exploring everything related to computer science.  
I enjoy learning by working on **hands-on projects**, and I’m always looking for new challenges.  
In my free time, I explore **game development**, but it remains a secondary passion.  
Here you’ll find my personal projects, experiments, and prototypes.

## 🛠️ Technologies I work with:
- **Languages**: C, Java, MySQL, GDScript, PHP, Python, JavaScript
- **Platforms**: Arduino, ESP32
- **Tools**: Git, VSCode, PlatformIO, NetBeans, Ampps, MySQL
- **Other**: IoT protocols, sensors, actuators

## 📂 Projects:
⭐ Featured Projects: 

**[Book Tracker](https://github.com/emanuele-rossi-4552/Book-Tracker)**

  A React Native (Expo) mobile app for managing a personal library: book cataloging, categories and subcategories, reading status, ratings, and comments.  
  The app is published on the Google Play Store (link available upon publication).

**[Humidity Control System](https://github.com/emanuele-rossi-4552/humidity-control)**

  An IoT system using an ESP32 to collect temperature and humidity data and send them to a server.  
  A React web app retrieves the data and allows visualization on both desktop and mobile devices.
  
Other Projects:
- **[Project Diary](https://github.com/emanuele-rossi-4552/Project-diary)**: A React app to track projects and ideas over time, with local data persistence via IndexedDB.
- **[Encrypted Chat - Client/Server with RSA](https://github.com/emanuele-rossi-4552/ClientServer-chat-crittografata)**: A Java application implementing an encrypted chat using a client-server architecture and RSA public-key cryptography.
- **[Automatic Plant Watering System](https://github.com/emanuele-rossi-4552/automatic-watering.git)**: An IoT project with ESP32 and sensors to automate plant watering.

## 🌱 Currently learning:
- Advanced IoT integrations (smart home, automation)
- Game development principles and design patterns
