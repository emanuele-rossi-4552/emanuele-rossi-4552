## Hi, I'm Emanuele 👋

I’m passionate about **IoT** and **embedded systems**, and I love exploring everything related to computer science.  
I enjoy learning by working on **hands-on projects**, and I’m always looking for new challenges.  
In my free time, I explore **game development**, but it remains a secondary passion.  
Here you’ll find my personal projects, experiments, and prototypes.

## 🛠️ Technologies I work with:
- **Languages**: C, Java, MySQL, GDScript, Python (occasionally), JavaScript (occasionally)
- **Platforms**: Arduino, ESP32
- **Tools**: Git, VSCode, PlatformIO, NetBeans, Ampps
- **Other**: IoT protocols, sensors, actuators

## 📂 Projects:
- **[Automatic Plant Watering System](https://github.com/emanuele-rossi-4552/automatic-watering.git)**: An IoT project with ESP32 and sensors to automate plant watering.
- **[Humidity Control System](https://github.com/emanuele-rossi-4552/humidity-control)**: An IoT project with ESP32 and sensors to read the data on humidity and archive them in a MySQL database. A REACT site reads and displays data as graphs.

## 🌱 Currently learning:
- Advanced IoT integrations (smart home, automation)
- Game development principles and design patterns
